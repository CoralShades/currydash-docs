## Files Requiring Manual Review

The following migrated files may need internal link updates:

1. Architecture files with cross-references
2. PRD files referencing other documents
3. Deployment guides with relative links

---

## Backup Location

Original files backed up to: `_backup/docs-original/`

---

## Next Steps

1. Review migrated content for broken links
2. Add missing _meta.js files for deeper sections
3. Create placeholder content for empty sections
4. Test all navigation paths
5. Deploy to Vercel
