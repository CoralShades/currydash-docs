=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: CurryDash Documentation - Tailwind v4 CSS Validation
Workspace: .auto-claude/worktrees/tasks/003-validate-tailwind-v4-css-compatibility
Started: 2026-01-22

Workflow Type: investigation
Rationale: This is an investigation workflow because we need to audit existing CSS for Tailwind v4 compatibility issues before we can fix them. The audit phase discovers what needs fixing, the investigate phase documents root causes, the fix phase applies solutions, and the verify phase ensures everything works correctly.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Completed deep codebase investigation
- Created project_index.json with project structure
- Created context.json with investigation findings
- Created implementation_plan.json with 4 phases and 11 subtasks
- Created init.sh setup script
- Created this build-progress.txt document

Phase Summary:

Phase 1 (CSS Audit): 4 subtasks, no dependencies
  - Install dependencies and verify build environment
  - Audit globals.css for Tailwind v4 compatibility issues
  - Audit component files for Tailwind class usage
  - Audit MDX content files for Tailwind usage

Phase 2 (Issue Analysis): 2 subtasks, depends on Phase 1
  - Consolidate audit reports and identify critical issues
  - Test current build output and document visual issues

Phase 3 (Apply Fixes): 3 subtasks, depends on Phase 2
  - Fix critical and high priority CSS issues in globals.css
  - Fix component Tailwind class usage if needed
  - Fix MDX content Tailwind usage if needed

Phase 4 (Verification): 3 subtasks, depends on Phase 3
  - Run full build and verify no CSS errors or warnings
  - Visual verification of all component rendering
  - Create final acceptance report

Services Involved:
  - docs: Next.js 16 + Nextra 4 + Tailwind v4 documentation site

Key Findings from Investigation:
  - Project already uses Tailwind v4 (@import "tailwindcss" syntax)
  - PostCSS configured correctly with @tailwindcss/postcss plugin
  - 383 lines of custom CSS in docs/app/globals.css
  - Extensive use of @apply directives (80+ instances)
  - Already using v4 @theme {} block for custom properties
  - Modern color/opacity syntax (bg-gray-900/50)
  - Dark mode variants throughout

Tailwind v4 Breaking Changes to Check:
  - Border color defaults changed
  - Gradient value preservation (may need via-none)
  - Arbitrary CSS variable syntax changed from bg-[--var] to bg-(--var)
  - Placeholder styles now use currentColor at 50% opacity
  - Button cursor changed to cursor: default
  - Container utility customization requires @utility directive

Parallelism Analysis:
  - Max parallel phases: 1
  - Recommended workers: 1
  - Speedup estimate: Sequential execution required due to investigation dependencies
  - Reasoning: Investigation workflows must complete audit before analysis, analysis before fixes, fixes before verification

Files to Audit/Modify:
  - docs/app/globals.css (383 lines, primary target)
  - docs/app/layout.tsx (component with Tailwind classes)
  - docs/mdx-components.tsx (custom MDX components)
  - docs/content/**/*.mdx (documentation content files)

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue with the implementation, run:

  cd docs && npm install && npm run dev

For automated execution with orchestrator:

  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 003 --parallel 1

=== NEXT STEPS ===

The coder agent will:
1. Start with Phase 1 (CSS Audit) subtasks
2. Install dependencies and verify build
3. Perform comprehensive audit of all CSS and Tailwind usage
4. Create audit reports documenting all findings
5. Proceed to Phase 2 to analyze and prioritize issues
6. Create investigation document with root causes
7. Proceed to Phase 3 to apply fixes
8. Complete Phase 4 verification and create acceptance report
