user_description: |
  CurryDash multi-repository documentation platform for food delivery service.

  Tech Stack:
  - Next.js 16.1.4 + Nextra 4.0.0 + Tailwind CSS v4
  - Integrates with currydash-admin-vendor-portal (Laravel) and currydash-mobile (Flutter)
  - Cross-repository automation via GitHub Actions
  - Semantic Release for versioning
  - BMAD Method workflows for documentation generation (*paige di, da, ds)

  Current Development State:
  - Active development with specific issues to resolve
  - Sidebar not visible (CSS/layout issue)
  - TOC "On This Page" missing
  - 380+ lines enterprise CSS applied
  - Tailwind v4 upgrade complete

  Goals:
  - Enterprise-grade docs matching svelteflow.dev
  - Multi-audience: Developers, Vendors, Admins
  - Cards with borders, shadows, hover effects
  - Code blocks with package manager tabs
