Implemented Vercel Web Analytics for Next.js App Router

Successfully installed and configured @vercel/analytics package for the CurryDash documentation site.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed @vercel/analytics package
- Used npm to install @vercel/analytics@^1.6.1
- Updated package.json to include the new dependency
- Updated package-lock.json with all required dependencies

### 2. Updated app/layout.tsx (Root Layout)
- Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/next'`
- Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, placed after the main `<Layout>` component
- Preserved all existing code structure and functionality

### 3. Verified Implementation
- Successfully built the project using `npm run build`
- Build completed with TypeScript checks passing
- Generated 111 static pages successfully
- Pagefind indexing completed without errors

## Files Modified
- `app/layout.tsx` - Added Analytics import and component
- `package.json` - Added @vercel/analytics dependency
- `package-lock.json` - Updated with new dependencies
- `next-env.d.ts` - Auto-updated by Next.js build process

## Implementation Details
This is an App Router project (using the app directory), so the Analytics component was added to the root layout file at `app/layout.tsx`. The component is placed at the end of the body tag, which is the recommended position for tracking scripts.

The Analytics component will automatically track page views and web vitals when the application is deployed to Vercel.

## Testing
- Build process completed successfully
- TypeScript compilation passed with no errors
- All 111 pages generated correctly
- No breaking changes introduced to existing functionality
