# GCP Deployment Framework for Claude Code

A self-contained, reusable framework for deploying any project type to Google Cloud Platform using Claude Code AI assistance.

## Overview

This framework provides Claude Code with all the knowledge, templates, and workflows needed to deploy your project to GCP. It supports multiple deployment options and project types, always providing cost analysis before any deployment actions.

## Supported Project Types

| Type | Deployment Target | Description |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| Flutter Web | Cloud Run | Static site with optional Cloud CDN |
| React/Vue | Cloud Run | Static SPA with nginx container |
| Next.js | Cloud Run | SSR with automatic scaling |
| Node.js API | Cloud Run / GCE | REST/GraphQL APIs |
| Laravel/PHP | Cloud Run / GCE | Full-stack with Cloud SQL |
| Python/FastAPI | Cloud Run | API backends |

## Supported GCP Services

- **Cloud Run** - Serverless containers (recommended for most cases)
- **Compute Engine (GCE)** - Virtual machines for persistent workloads
- **Cloud SQL** - Managed MySQL/PostgreSQL
- **Cloud Storage** - Static file hosting and buckets
- **Artifact Registry** - Docker image repository
- **Secret Manager** - Secure credential storage
- **Cloud Build** - CI/CD pipelines
- **Cloud Deploy** - Release management
- **VPC Connector** - Private networking

## Quick Start

### 1. Copy to Your Project

Copy this entire `gcp-deployment-framework/` directory to your project's `docs/` folder:

```bash
cp -r gcp-deployment-framework/ /path/to/your-project/docs/
```

### 2. Add CLAUDE.md Reference

Add the following to your project's `CLAUDE.md` (or create one):

```markdown
## GCP Deployment

This project uses the GCP Deployment Framework. See `docs/gcp-deployment-framework/` for:
- Deployment guides and templates
- Cost analysis before any deployment
- MCP server integration for GCP documentation

When asked to deploy to GCP:
1. Read `docs/gcp-deployment-framework/CLAUDE-GCP-GUIDE.md` first
2. Follow the deployment decision workflow
3. Always provide cost breakdown before executing
```

### 3. Configure Your Project

Edit `docs/gcp-deployment-framework/project-config.yaml` with your project details.

## GCP Account

This framework is configured for:
- **Account**: demi@coralshades.ai
- **Default Region**: australia-southeast1 (Sydney)

Update `project-config.yaml` if using different credentials.

## MCP Server Integration

This framework leverages MCP servers for dynamic documentation:

| Server | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `cloudflare-docs` | DNS, CDN, WAF configuration |
| `perplexity` | Research GCP best practices |
| `cloudflare-workers` | Edge deployments |

## Cost Philosophy

**Always ask before spending money.**

This framework follows these principles:
1. **Free Tier First** - Maximize GCP free tier usage
2. **Cost Transparency** - Show monthly estimates before deployment
3. **User Approval** - Never deploy without explicit confirmation
4. **Optimization** - Suggest cheapest options that meet requirements
