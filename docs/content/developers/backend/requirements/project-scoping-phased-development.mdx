# Project Scoping & Phased Development

## MVP Strategy & Philosophy

**MVP Approach:** Platform MVP with Operational Excellence Focus

CurryDash's MVP prioritizes operational capability over feature breadth. The strategy is to enable vendors to serve customers reliably while admins maintain platform quality - a "functioning marketplace" rather than a "feature-complete platform."

**Philosophy Rationale:**
- **Brownfield Advantage**: Existing StackFood codebase provides 80% of infrastructure
- **Vendor-First Launch**: 50+ active vendors needed before customer marketing
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Cultural authenticity positioning requires careful vendor onboarding
- **Subscription Foundation**: Package system (CPFP) is the differentiator - must work flawlessly

**MVP Success Definition:**
"A vendor can register, create curry pack menus, receive orders, and get paid. An admin can approve vendors, monitor quality, and resolve issues. A customer can discover, order, subscribe, and receive food."

## MVP Feature Boundaries

**Essential User Journeys Supported (MVP):**

| Journey | MVP Coverage | Deferred Features |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| Dilan (Established Vendor) | Menu mgmt, orders, basic analytics | Advanced forecasting, multi-location |
| Amara (New Vendor) | Registration, onboarding, first order | Video assessment automation |
| Kasun (Vendor Staff) | Order dashboard, status workflow | Kitchen display integration |
| Sarah (Admin Operations) | Vendor review, quality monitoring | Automated alerts, predictive scoring |
| Raj (Support Agent) | Basic ticket queue, refunds | Full case management, knowledge base |
| David (Super Admin) | User/role mgmt, basic exports | Custom report builder, advanced audit |
| Nisha (Accountant) | Financial reports, GST exports | Batch downloads, multi-vendor view |

**Must-Have Capabilities (Phase 1):**

**Vendor Portal (CAR):**
- Self-service registration with document upload
- Restaurant profile management (hours, zones, details)
- Package configuration builder (curry pack setup)
- Menu management (food items, categories, add-ons)
- Real-time order dashboard with accept/prepare/ready workflow
- Basic analytics (orders, revenue, ratings summary)
- Notification system (new orders, status updates)

**Admin Dashboard (CAD):**
- Vendor application queue with approval/rejection
- Vendor profile view and status management
- Order monitoring with search and filters
- Customer complaint queue (basic resolution)
- Platform analytics dashboard (daily/weekly KPIs)
- User and role management (RBAC)

**Backend APIs (CUR):**
- All 70 frontend PRD functional requirements
- Authentication (JWT for mobile, session for dashboards)
- Package and subscription endpoints
- Payment processing (Stripe integration)
- Push notification triggers

## Resource Requirements

**MVP Team Composition:**

| Role | Count | Responsibilities |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| Tech Lead / Senior Laravel Dev | 1 | Architecture decisions, code review, complex features |
| Backend Developer | 1-2 | Feature implementation, API development, testing |
| Frontend Developer | 0.5 | Blade template updates, admin UI improvements |
| QA Engineer | 0.5 | Manual testing, regression, UAT coordination |
| Product Manager | 0.5 | Requirements clarification, stakeholder alignment |
| DevOps | 0.25 | Deployment, monitoring, infrastructure |

**Skills Required:**
- Laravel 9.x+ expertise (Eloquent, Passport, Blade)
- PHP 8.1+ proficiency
- MySQL 8.0+ optimization and query tuning
- REST API design and documentation
- Payment gateway integration (Stripe)
- Git workflow and code review practices

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

**Technical Risks:**

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| No test coverage (0%) | High | Implement critical path tests first; cover order and payment flows |
| Monolithic CentralLogics | Medium | Incremental service extraction; don't refactor during MVP |
| No queue system | Medium | Accept synchronous operations for MVP; add queues for Phase 2 |
| Performance at scale | Medium | Add caching for hot paths (restaurant lists, menu data) |

**Market Risks:**

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Vendor adoption slow | High | Focus on 10-15 pilot vendors for soft launch; white-glove onboarding |
| Competition from majors | Medium | Emphasize cultural niche; avoid head-to-head feature competition |
| Subscription model confusion | Medium | Clear UI differentiation between one-time and subscription orders |

**Resource Risks:**

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Key developer unavailable | High | Document architecture decisions; maintain comprehensive docs |
| Scope creep | High | Strict MVP boundary enforcement; defer "nice-to-haves" aggressively |
| Timeline pressure | Medium | Prioritize vendor-facing features; admin polish can follow |

**Contingency Plan (Reduced Resources):**
If resources are limited, prioritize:
1. Vendor order management (must transact)
2. Admin vendor approval (must onboard)
3. Basic analytics (must measure)
4. Advanced features (defer entirely)
