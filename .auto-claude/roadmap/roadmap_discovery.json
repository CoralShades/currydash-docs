      "Food vendors and restaurant owners using the Seller Portal",
      "Platform administrators managing the CurryDash system",
      "DevOps engineers handling deployment and infrastructure",
      "Technical writers maintaining documentation"
    ],
    "pain_points": [
      "Documentation scattered across multiple repositories",
      "Difficulty keeping docs in sync with rapidly evolving codebase",
      "Lack of centralized knowledge base for multi-team collaboration",
      "Manual documentation updates are error-prone and time-consuming",
      "Different audiences need different levels of technical detail"
    ],
    "goals": [
      "Quickly understand the CurryDash platform architecture",
      "Find accurate API documentation for integration work",
      "Learn how to use the Seller Portal effectively",
      "Onboard new team members efficiently",
      "Keep documentation automatically synchronized with code changes"

  "product_vision": {
    "one_liner": "A centralized, automatically-synchronized documentation platform for the CurryDash Sri Lankan food delivery service ecosystem.",
    "problem_statement": "CurryDash operates across multiple repositories (Laravel backend, Flutter apps) with different audiences (developers, vendors, admins). Without centralized documentation, knowledge becomes fragmented, onboarding is slow, and keeping docs current with code changes requires significant manual effort.",
    "value_proposition": "CurryDash Docs provides a single source of truth that automatically stays in sync with code repositories using BMAD Method workflows and semantic versioning. It delivers audience-specific content (developers, vendors, admins) through a modern, searchable Nextra-powered documentation site with a headless API for integration.",
    "success_metrics": [
      "Documentation coverage of all major features across both repositories",
      "Reduced time-to-productivity for new team members (<1 week onboarding)",
      "Documentation freshness (auto-sync latency <24 hours after code merge)",
      "Search effectiveness (Pagefind index covers all content)",
      "API documentation completeness for all REST endpoints",
      "Positive feedback from all three audience segments"

      "MDX content support with React components",

    "technical_debt": [
      "Legacy docs in docs-legacy/ need migration/consolidation",
      "Outdated templates in 'bmad-docops/templates - outdated' folder",

      "Self-hosted control over documentation infrastructure"
